# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

A file-based, spec-driven development workflow for Claude Code. Slash commands, scripts, and templates get installed globally to `~/.claude/` via `setup.sh`. Target projects get `knowledge-base/` and `specs/` via `/bootstrap`. One external dependency: `yq` for YAML parsing.

**This repo is not a typical codebase** — it's markdown command definitions, shell scripts, and a Rust TUI dashboard. No application code lives here.

## Project Structure

- `commands/*.md` — Slash command definitions (bootstrap, explore, propose, implement, validate, review-findings, ship, pr-review, spec-status, workflow-summary)
- `scripts/task-manager.sh` — Task state machine (validate, set-status, unblock, next, check-unvalidated, status). Requires `yq`.
- `scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh` — Commit-time task validation
- `agents/` — Specialized agent definitions for validation gates and workflow assistance. Installed to `~/.claude/agents/` by `setup.sh`.
- `templates/` — CLAUDE.md template and gitignore additions for target projects
- `workflow-tui/` — Rust TUI dashboard for viewing spec/task status
- `onboarding.md` — Full workflow documentation
- `plan.md` — Original design document

## Build & Run

### Setup (install commands globally)

```bash
./setup.sh          # install to ~/.claude/
./setup.sh --force  # overwrite existing files
```

### Workflow TUI (Rust)

```bash
cd workflow-tui
cargo build
cargo run -- /path/to/project   # project must contain specs/ directory
```

Dependencies: ratatui, crossterm, notify (file watcher), serde_yml, clap, anyhow. Edition 2024.

### Prerequisites

`yq` (`brew install yq`), `gh` (`brew install gh`)

## Workflow TUI Architecture

Elm-like architecture with file-system watching for live reload:

- `main.rs` — CLI parsing (clap), terminal setup, event loop
- `app.rs` — Application state and update logic
- `event.rs` — Event polling (keyboard, terminal resize)
- `watcher.rs` — File system watcher (notify) for live-reloading specs
- `model/` — Domain types: `spec.rs`, `task.rs`, `report.rs`
- `parse/` — File parsers: `scanner.rs` (directory scanning), `task_parser.rs`, `report_parser.rs`, `frontmatter.rs` (generic YAML frontmatter)
- `ui/` — Ratatui widgets: `layout.rs`, `spec_list.rs`, `progress.rs`, `reports.rs`, `dep_graph.rs`, `styles.rs`

## Slash Command Conventions

- Commands receive feature name via `$ARGUMENTS`
- All task status changes go through `task-manager.sh` — never edit YAML frontmatter directly
- Task state machine: `blocked -> todo -> in-progress -> implemented -> review -> done`
- Enforced flow per task: `/implement` -> `/validate` -> `/review-findings` (if findings) -> `/ship` -> merge PR -> next task
- Serial execution only — one task in flight at a time

## Key Design Decisions

- `/ship` is separate from `/implement` — commit/push/PR creation happens after validation
- `/implement` checks for unmerged PRs — previous task's PR must be merged before starting next
- Validation tools defined in language file frontmatter `validation_tools` are mandatory; skipping is not allowed
- `/validate` Phase 2 spawns specialized agents in parallel (security, code-quality, architecture, compliance) instead of inline LLM analysis
- Agent findings are advisory (`source: llm`), tool findings are high-confidence (`source: tool`); both go through `/review-findings`
- Rejected findings can become new knowledge-base rules (feedback loop)
